# Firebase Shared Drawing

This Android application demonstrates the use of the Firebase SDK to create a shared drawing canvas.
Multiple users can run the app and draw on the same canvas. Line segments are synchronized as the user draws them.

The drawing and color-picking portions of this application are largely adapted from Google's ApiDemo application, shipped
with the [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) as part of the
[sample code](https://developer.android.com/tools/samples/index.html).

This example is intended to demonstrate how you can adapt single-user applications to be collaborative with the help of
[Firebase](https://www.firebase.com). Create your own Firebase and incorporate these techniques into your own application!
Also, check out our [Quickstart guide](https://www.firebase.com/docs/java-quickstart.html) for more information on setting up the Firebase SDK on Android.
